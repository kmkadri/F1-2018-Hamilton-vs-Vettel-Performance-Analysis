# Comparative Analysis of Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel's Performance in the 2018 Formula 1 Season

## Introduction
This project involves a comprehensive data-driven analysis of the performance of two prominent Formula 1 drivers, Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel, during the 2018 season. The analysis aims to determine which driver had a superior performance based on various metrics such as race results, qualifying times, and points earned.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis was sourced from Kaggle, consisting of data on races, podium finishes, driver standings, lap times, and pit stops from the 2018 Formula 1 season.

## Analysis
The analysis focuses on several key areas:
- **Race Performance:** Comparison of race outcomes between Hamilton and Vettel.
- **Qualifying Performance:** Analysis of starting grid positions and their conversion to race outcomes.
- **Lap Times:** Statistical comparison of average lap times.
- **Pit Stops:** Evaluation of the efficiency and impact of pit stops on race performance.
- **Strategies:** Assessment of race strategies including tire management and pit stop timing.

## Results
The findings indicate that Lewis Hamilton outperformed Sebastian Vettel in several areas, including average lap times, fewer pit stops, and more consistent podium finishes. The analysis showed statistically significant differences in performance, favoring Hamilton for the 2018 season.

## Conclusion
The analysis concludes that Lewis Hamilton had a stronger overall performance in the 2018 Formula 1 season compared to Sebastian Vettel, particularly in terms of race consistency and lap times.
